        So my love of programmming did not start right away.  I had to realize a lot of 
        things in my life.  I originally was trying to be a drafter.  I realized that the 
        prospects for this field are not as great as I thought.  A lot of luck and things
        had to happen for me to realize why this was important.  One of the 
        most important things that had to occur was the invention of the smart phone.
        This lead to the web coming to people's hands.  I do not believe the web would
        be as public friendly if this had not occured.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Another important event that had to occur was the realization that you can 
            get a job in the field.  I know that sounds goofy now that the web has grown
            so much but this was an actual concern then.
